        <h2>Project Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal for this project was to be able to easily look up different starships from Star Wars using APIs. Most APIs I found were a
            continuation of the old SWAPI, mostly just for hosing reasons. There was one that was entirely in Wookiee, but I landed on SWAPI.info just
            for ease of use. I wanted to make this database so I could easily look up ships while playing SW5E, a Star Wars D&D skin.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Notes</h2>
        <p>The project meets requirements by having filters for the movie the ship appeared in, the class of the ship, and how many passengers it can hold.
            It saves your filters into local storage and will auto insert them on site reload, but won't search for you.
            The styles for this project really came from w3schools, looking up specific controls and adapting it for my use. I landed on black and yellow
            in homage to the Star Wars opening crawl, but made the background a subtle gradient to fade into navy blue. I did this because just black
            was too harsh, but going too navy didn't look good. I made all the filters line up on one line instead of 3 seperate just so that on most screens
            the status of the search would show up. Most of the actual javascript was pretty simple, just modifying what was used in GIPHY but with no API key. If I had
            more time, I would like to have been able to link the cards to the correct Wookieepedia page or add images for each.
