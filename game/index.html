        <h1>Description</h1>

        <p><strong>Dig Dug</strong> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.
            <br>Stopping you from doing this are two <em>monsters</em>, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around.
            <br>The only weapon that you carry is an <strong>air pump</strong>, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]
