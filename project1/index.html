                        <p>In Hades II, you play as Melinoë, daughter of Hades, on her quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. Death has little meaning to her, each time you
                            fall, she will simply return to the Crossroads and start her adventure again. The further you progress towards your goal, the more you learn about Melinoë and her companions at the Crossroads.
