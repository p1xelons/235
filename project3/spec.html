        <h2>Project Notes</h2>
        <p>My plan for project 3 is to recreate the popular snake game. It's a game I used to play all the time during class, and that
            I found myself annoyed at the Google version of. Being able to recreate it and edit it to my liking sounds awesome. I plan to use
            PixiJS to implement sprites and movement as well as audio.  
        </p>
